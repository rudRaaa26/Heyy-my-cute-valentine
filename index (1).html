      Babe, I love you so freaking much. Honestly, I don’t even know how to explain it. Sometimes, I mess up and make mistakes, but I want to fix them all. I want to be your support system, like you’ve been mine. You’ve been my rock, supporting me for so long. And the best part? You actually <span class="highlight">get</span> me. That’s all I need. Nothing else matters. It’s just you... and us.
      <br><br>
      So, Miss Chaand <3 :)
      <br><br>
      We first met on April 22, and slowly, a beautiful friendship started. At first, we just talked in the GC, but then our convos moved to my private DMs, and we’d joke around on TL. Over time, we became close—really close. You were the first girl I ever talked to this much. I could open up to you, and you did the same with me. And for that, I’m so grateful.
      <br><br>
      Then you pulled me onto Insta, and that’s when we got even closer. You added me to your GC, and yeah, I left later after asking you, but by then, I was already feeling so comfortable with you. Slowly, we kept getting closer and closer, and at some point—I don’t even know when—I just knew. I wanted to see you happy, to see you get everything you deserve. But you were stuck in your own struggles, and I just wanted to be there for you.
      <br><br>
      And then, at the perfect time, we both confessed. And now, we’re here. We’ve had fights, we’ve had moments where it felt like this wouldn’t be easy—but we made it through. And we will always make it through. No matter what happens, I’m here. Always.
      <br><br>
      Thank you for making my life so freaking beautiful.
      <br><br>
      I love you, forever.
